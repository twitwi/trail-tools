# Livetrail

home of a race is data + link to a php-xsl that formats it
where the subrace id is $e/@id (e.g. utmj, linx)


getting the table for a race at https://utmj.livetrail.run/passages.php, with some formdata
but in the end it is
https://utmj.livetrail.run/passages.php?course=utmj&cat=scratch&from=1&to=1000


The distance and D+ are in a single /parcours.php url for all subcourses

The starting time might need to be taken from hp(remier) hd(ernier) in the first parcours point.

... got slightly less than 1 million bibs
